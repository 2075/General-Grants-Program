# Polkadot Substrate Swift API

## Project Description

### Brief Description
Polkadot integration Swift API for Substrate allows to read chain information and state, block details, as well as sign and publish transactions in Swift. It also allows to subscribe to substrate node websocket endpoints and receive data updates.

* A POC is under development here: (https://github.com/playzero/polkadot-swift)
* Scale Codec is under development here: (https://github.com/playzero/swift-scale)

### Why a Swift API is Good for the Ecosystem

Currently many toolchains exist providing integration of frontends on web and mobile to the network. While it is good to already have a set of JavaScript / TypeScript based Libraries, fiddling with React Native and the likes to create device specific implementations with a native appeal is still an unconvincing developer experience and carries high risk for development teams. This is a blocker for adoption if you want to produce quality products at scale.

Polkadot Swift API will enable teams building native applications on iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS to enable interaction of two trusted ecosystems.

### How Swift API Integrates into Substrate
Substrate provides secure WebSocket endpoints, which are used directly by the Swift API.
Parity Scale Codec has to be ported first.

### Why our Team is Interested
We are building GameDAO, which will be a legal DAO cooperative and a videogames industry oriented crowd finance platform. Polkadot and Substrate are core technologies of our product stack and therefore we aim to provide the best development and user experience to our ecosystem users.

## Development Roadmap
Project roadmap and financial plan will be shared privately via Google Form.

Our team is working on various software and hardware projects, currently GameDAO which is implementing a legal cooperative as DAO on substrate.

## Additional Information

### What work has been done so far?
* Analysis of dependencies and similar projects
* Repo and CI/CD
* Initial tests to port parity-scale-codec

### Are there any other projects similar to yours? How is our project different?
So far there has only been the JavaScript API.
